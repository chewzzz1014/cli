## Updating User Passwords
The passwd command is used to update a userâ€™s password. Users can only change their own passwords, whereas the root user can update the password for any user.

```
passwd [OPTIONS] [USER]
```

```
sysadmin@localhost:~$ passwd                                                    
Changing password for sysadmin.                                                 
(current) UNIX password:                                                        
Enter new UNIX password:                                                       
Retype new UNIX password:                                                       
passwd: password updated successfully
